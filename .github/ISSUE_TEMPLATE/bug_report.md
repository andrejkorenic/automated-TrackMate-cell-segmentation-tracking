# Issue Template: **Automated Cell Segmentation and Tracking Using TrackMate**

Please fill out as much detail as possible. The more information you provide, the faster we can diagnose and fix any problems!

## Prerequisites

Before submitting this issue, please ensure:

- [ ] I am using the recommended version of Fiji (ImageJ)
- [ ] I have checked the documentation files for relevant information.
- [ ] I have searched existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- [ ] This issue is related to a script and not a general ImageJ/Fiji problem.

=== **YOU MAY DELETE THIS TEMPLATE INTRODUCTION.** ===

## General Information

### Expected Behavior

Describe what you *expect* the script to do in this situation. Be as specific as possible.

### Current Behavior

Describe what the script is *actually* doing instead of what you expect. Include any error messages or unexpected results.

### Failure Information

If applicable, include any error messages or unexpected results.

#### Steps to Reproduce

Provide *detailed* steps to reproduce the issue. Include:

1. Load the following image(s): [Describe the images - type, dimensions, bit depth, etc.]
2. Run the script with these parameters: [List any input parameters and their values]
3. Observe this result: [Describe what you see/the error message]

#### Sample Data (Highly Recommended)

If possible, attach a small sample dataset that reliably reproduces the issue.  This significantly speeds up debugging!  (e.g., .tif file).

## Context (Environment)

Provide information about your system and ImageJ setup. This is crucial for diagnosing environment-specific issues:

*   **ImageJ Version:** [e.g., 1.54g]  (Go to Help > About...)
*   **Operating System:** [e.g., Windows 10, macOS Monterey, Ubuntu 20.04]
*   **Java Version:** [e.g., Java 1.8.0_271] (Check in your system's information)
*   **Plugins Used:**  List any plugins that are used by the script or might be relevant to the issue.
*   **Image Type/Format:** Describe the type of images you are working with (e.g., confocal, fluorescence microscopy, grayscale, RGB).
*   **Bit Depth:** [e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit]

## Additional Information

Anything else that might be relevant to understanding the issue. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps already?  If so, what were they and what was the result?
