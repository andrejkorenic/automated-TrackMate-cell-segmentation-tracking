## 🔬 A Set of ImageJ/Fiji Scripts for Automated Analysis of Fluorescent Microscopy Images: Cell Segmentation and Tracking with TrackMate

Save time analyzing thousands of cells with automated ImageJ/Fiji scripts designed for fluorescent microscopy. These scripts leverage the power of TrackMate plugin to streamline cell segmentation and tracking, making it easier than ever to analyze large datasets efficiently. The process begins with a coarse-grained segmentation, followed by precise detection and tracking using cutting-edge algorithms available in TrackMate. Once calibrated, you can automate your workflow making it ideal for researchers handling large datasets in fluorescence microscopy.

## 📌 Features

* **Automated Cell Analysis with TrackMate:** Streamline fluorescent microscopy workflows using the TrackMate plugin, featuring a suite of integrated methods for efficient segmentation and tracking.
* **Two-Step Segmentation & Tracking:**
    * Coarse segmentation for quick cell identification.
    * Fine tracking for precise cell detection and monitoring over time or in 3D.
* **Flexible Workflow:** TrackMate supports both temporal (time-based) and spatial (3D) tracking, allowing you to choose the method best suited for your research.
* **Efficient Dataset Analysis:** Save time by automating workflows for large microscopy datasets.
* **Post-Tracking Segmentation Refinement:** Enhance accuracy by fine-tuning segmentation using tracking data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

For instructions on setting up your environment, understanding the collection's organization, and effectively running the scripts, please refer to the *Installation*, *Files and Folders Structure*, and *Usage* sections below.

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Download & Extract:** Download the entire repository from GitHub and extract the contents to a convenient directory on your Windows, Linux, or macOS system.
2. **Install Fiji & Plugins:**  These scripts rely on ImageJ/Fiji and several plugins. 
    *  Ensure you have a stable version of Fiji installed ([https://imagej.net/software/fiji/](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/)). Tested and compatible with ImageJ/Fiji 1.54g.
    * TrackMate v7 can be found at `Plugins → Tracking → TrackMate` since TrackMate resides in the `/jars` subfolder of the `Fiji.app` folder (i.e., `TrackMate-7.14.0.jar`)
    * Open Fiji, then go to `Help → Update → Manage update sites`. Add the following update site (if not already present):
        * 3D ImageJ Suite
        * IJPB-plugins ([MorphoLibJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/morpholibj) library)
        * StarDist *(optional)*
        * TrackMate-StarDist *(optional)*
3. **Stay Updated:** Regularly check for updates to ensure optimal performance: Open Fiji, then go to `Help → Update → Apply changes → Restart Fiji` when prompted.

### 📂 Files and Folders Structure

The following diagram illustrates how this collection's files and folders are organized, making it easier to navigate and understand its components:
```plaintext
/root
    ├── analysis_input/              # Input images for bulk analysis
    ├── analysis_output/             # Output from bulk analysis
    ├── setup_input/                 # Input images for setup
    ├── setup_output/                # Output from setup process
    │   ├── 01_segmentation          # Segmentation results
    │   ├── 02_tracking              # Tracking results
    │   └── 03_final                 # Final results
    ├── setup_settings/              # Setup settings files (generated by setup.ijm)
    ├── refineMask.ijm               # IJM script for segmentation refinement
    ├── setup.ijm                    # Main IJM script for automation procedure
    ├── automated_analysis.py        # Jython script (bulk analysis)
    ├── README.md                    # Project overview
    ├── LICENSE.txt                  # GPL-3.0 license
    └── requirements.txt             # Script dependencies
```

### 📖 Usage

This collection of scripts is designed for ease of use, with built-in guidance through each step.
1. **Setup:** Use the `Plugins > Macros > Run...` command in Fiji to run `setup.ijm`. The script will guide you interactively, providing clear instructions at each stage of the setup process. This ensures you understand and configure the settings correctly.
2. **Saving Calibration Settings:**  Upon completion, your customized setup parameters will be saved in both the `setup_settings` and the `setup_output` folder as part of the setup results. You can save these settings as `.zip` archive for future analysis runs on similar datasets.
3. **Bulk Analysis:** Once your setup is complete, run `automated_analysis.py`.  This script automatically analyzes all image files located in the `analysis_input` folder using the previously saved parameters. Results will be generated and saved within the `analysis_output` folder.

<!-- ISSUES AND ROADMAP -->
## 🚩 Known Issues and Future Improvements

**Current Issues:**
* Users may encounter issues with TrackMate regarding saving and loading `xml` files containing analysis settings. This can lead to problems during automated analysis. We're actively working on resolving these issues and will provide updates as they become available.

**Future Improvements:**
* Implement segmentation using one channel and tracking using a different channel. 
* Automate measurement calculations based on final analyzed images.
* Save all analysis results in a user-friendly format, such as `csv`.
